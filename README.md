# Numusic

Numusic is a text-based descriptive language two write numbered musical notation. Details of its syntax can be found in [overview.txt](https://github.com/ansharlubis/numusic/blob/master/overview.txt)

Its purpose currently is only to calculate the optimum assignment of the musical instrument [Angklung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angklung) in a group. An angklung can only produce a specific tone, thus it requires a lot of people to perform songs. A score written in this language can easily be converted into a list of players with their assigned instruments and play intervals, free from conflicts.

## Using Numusic

Simply run 'parse.py' with a score file

'''python
python parse.py file/path
